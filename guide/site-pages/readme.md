# Site pages

- All `tsx` files for pages named `index.tsx`.
- Folder names are names of pages.
- Folder names in `train-case`, examples:
  - `pages/about-us`
  - `pages/photo-gallery`
- Pages nested to match site hierarchy.
- Components belong in the `components/` folder, not in the page files.
- One component (the page) per `index.html` file.
- Keep page files short (e.g., 50 lines or fewer).
- Pages should be really simple: put the logic in the components.
